## Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-predictor.git
cd stock-price-predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook file `stock-price-predictor.ipynb` and run the cells to execute the code. Ensure you have the dataset available in the appropriate directory or update the path to your dataset.

## Features
- **Data preprocessing:** Handling missing values, scaling, and normalization.
- **Data visualization:** Plotting stock prices and other relevant metrics.
- **Model building:** Constructing and training LSTM models for stock price prediction.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) score.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains historical stock prices, including open, close, high, low, and volume data. Ensure you have the dataset file in the specified directory or update the path in the notebook accordingly.

## Model
The primary model used in this project is an LSTM neural network, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) suitable for time series forecasting. The model architecture includes layers for LSTM, Dense, and Dropout.

## Results
The results section includes various plots and metrics to evaluate the performance of the model in predicting stock prices. You can find detailed visualizations and evaluation metrics in the notebook.
